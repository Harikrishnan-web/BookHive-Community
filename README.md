I was Bored and I didn't know what to do and suddenly an old friend of mine asked can you review the book "Ikigai", I am a book reader who read 10+ Books at the year 2025 so I had an idea to develop the community only for book readers, where they can post and share what they read and share their thoughts and the public can view their posts and also the user can manage theier own posts and profile
So here's the link to become a part of this community: [Bookhive](https://harikrishnan-web.github.io/BookHive-Community/)
